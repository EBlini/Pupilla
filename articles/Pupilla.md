## Scope

This is a collection of functions and wrappers that are useful for
preprocessing and analysis of eyetracking data, with a special focus on
pupillometry. Functions are generally hardware-agnostic, and have been
designed for data collected through third-part experiment builders such
as OpenSesame. Functions have been tested on Windows machines.

All functions are to be considered under development: all requests or
suggestions are more than welcome, :) .
