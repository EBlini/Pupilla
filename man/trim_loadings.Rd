\title{Trim rPCA loadings according to heuristics and append them to the original object}
\usage{
trim_loadings(rpca_mod, keep_max = T, abs_value = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{rpca_mod}{An object returned by 'reduce_rPCA'.}

\item{keep_max}{If TRUE, for each timepoint only the
largest loading (in absolute value) is preserved, the
remaining ones are set to 0.}

\item{abs_value}{An absolute value below which loadings
are set to 0}
}
\value{
The original object in which information about the trimming has been added
}
\description{
Under development. This function takes a 'reduce_rPCA' object,
and only a 'reduce_rPCA' object, and trims the original loadings.
The trimmed loadings can then be used for (new) predictions
with 'predict_feature()', for example. One reason why
this could be useful is to reduce collinearity between
rotated components - albeit one can also consider orthogonal solutions.
